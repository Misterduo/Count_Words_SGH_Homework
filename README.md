# Count_Words_SGH_Homework
This is my second homework for my SGH class for Python studies. Please use the file called "CountOfUniqueWords.py" - it was the first file I created and it has the code needed to perform the counting (used the Shrek script, to brighten up my mood during the code preparation).
Additionally created the second file called "CountOfWords2.py" just to see an alternative text get counted (This one uses the Bee Movie script for the similar reason).
If there are any possible code improvements - please let me know, so that I won't do a similar mistake in the future, as I believe Python will be a major part of my career. Thank you for your attention!
